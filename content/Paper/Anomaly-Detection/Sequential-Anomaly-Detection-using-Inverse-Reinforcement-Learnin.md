# Introduction

*   Anomaly detection refers to identification of unforeseen or abnormal phenomena embedded in a large amount of normal data

*   One of the most interesting application scenarios in anomaly detection is when sequential datas are targeted → This is more complex then static anomalies

*   The main contribution of this paper is,

    *   First time to use inverse RL

    *   Incorporating model uncertainty in the IRL problem

    *   Incorporate trajectories with varying lengths

    *   Publicly available real-word data shows this method is effective
